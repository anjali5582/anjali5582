## About MeðŸ˜Š

My name is Anjali and Iâ€™m a Junior Computer Science student, minoring in Buisness, and am eager to grow skills and experience through research and industry exposure. Through my volunteer and job experiences, I've developed a strong work ethic, leadership abilities, and interpersonal skills. Iâ€™ve seen first hand how technology can impact others greatly, and Iâ€™m excited to work directly on applications that create positive impact on people.

I am passionate about applying my technical skills to innovative projects within the industry. My academic background has equipped me with a solid foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking. Combined with my proficiency with programming languages such as Java and Python, as well as my ability to learn and adapt, I am well prepared to contribute to and solve complex technical challenges. 

I aim to leverage these skills to enrich team environments through effective and concise communication while contributing to project goals. I look forward to connecting with professionals and organizations that share my enthusiasm for technology and learning through internships or research opportunities.


## Projects

Predicting Life Ladder
This project focuses on predicting the Life Ladder, a measure of subjective well being or life satisfaction using socioeconomic and health related data from multiple countries. The goal is to build a robust machine learning model that accurately estimates life satisfaction scores based on features like GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, social support, and more.
